# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Why do I do Advent of Code:
- to get better at solving programming problems
- to get more experience in other languages
- because it's fun

My code is probably not very good because I usually write the solution until I get the correct answer, and then leave the code as it is without cleaning it up.
